Working closely with medical professionals at the [Hartford Hospital](https://hartfordhospital.org/) and game devs at [First Playable](http://www.1stplayable.com/), our goal is to develop a training app that can replace medical professional when training heart transplant patients on how to fill up their weekly medication box. This is an ongoing project, however I took a snap shot of the project when we were handing it off.
